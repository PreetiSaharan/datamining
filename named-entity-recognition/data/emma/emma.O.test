CHAPTER	O
II	O
Mr	O
Weston	O
was	O
a	O
native	O
of	O
Highbury	O
and	O
born	O
of	O
a	O
respectable	O
family	O
which	O
for	O
the	O
last	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
generations	O
had	O
been	O
rising	O
into	O
gentility	O
and	O
property	O
He	O
had	O
received	O
a	O
good	O
education	O
but	O
on	O
succeeding	O
early	O
in	O
life	O
to	O
a	O
small	O
independence	O
had	O
become	O
indisposed	O
for	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
more	O
homely	O
pursuits	O
in	O
which	O
his	O
brothers	O
were	O
engaged	O
and	O
had	O
satisfied	O
an	O
active	O
cheerful	O
mind	O
and	O
social	O
temper	O
by	O
entering	O
into	O
the	O
militia	ORG
of	O
his	O
county	ORG
then	O
embodied	O
Captain	O
Weston	O
was	O
a	O
general	O
favorite	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
chances	O
of	O
his	O
military	O
life	O
had	O
introduced	O
him	O
to	O
Miss	O
Churchill	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
Yorkshire	O
family	O
and	O
Miss	O
Churchill	O
fell	O
in	O
love	O
with	O
him	O
nobody	O
was	O
surprized	O
except	O
her	O
brother	O
and	O
his	O
wife	O
who	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
him	O
and	O
who	O
were	O
full	O
of	O
pride	O
and	O
importance	O
which	O
the	O
connexion	O
would	O
offend	O
Miss	O
Churchill	O
however	O
being	O
of	O
age	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
full	O
command	O
of	O
her	O
fortune	O
though	O
her	O
fortune	O
bore	O
no	O
proportion	O
to	O
the	O
family	O
estate	O
was	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
dissuaded	O
from	O
the	O
marriage	O
and	O
it	O
took	O
place	O
to	O
the	O
infinite	O
mortification	O
of	O
Mr	O
and	O
Mrs	O
Churchill	O
who	O
threw	O
her	O
off	O
with	O
due	O
decorum	O
It	O
was	O
an	O
unsuitable	O
connexion	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
produce	O
much	O
happiness	O
Mrs	O
Weston	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
found	O
more	O
in	O
it	O
for	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
husband	O
whose	O
warm	O
heart	O
and	O
sweet	O
temper	O
made	O
him	O
think	O
every	O
thing	O
due	O
to	O
her	O
in	O
return	O
for	O
the	O
great	O
goodness	O
of	O
being	O
in	O
love	O
with	O
him	O
but	O
though	O
she	O
had	O
one	O
sort	O
of	O
spirit	O
she	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
best	O
She	O
had	O
resolution	O
enough	O
to	O
pursue	O
her	O
own	O
will	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
her	O
brother	O
but	O
not	O
enough	O
to	O
refrain	O
from	O
unreasonable	O
regrets	O
at	O
that	O
brother	O
's	O
unreasonable	O
anger	O
nor	O
from	O
missing	O
the	O
luxuries	O
of	O
her	O
former	O
home	O
They	O
lived	O
beyond	O
their	O
income	O
but	O
still	O
it	O
was	O
nothing	O
in	O
comparison	O
of	O
Enscombe	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
cease	O
to	O
love	O
her	O
husband	O
but	O
she	O
wanted	O
at	O
once	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
wife	O
of	O
Captain	O
Weston	O
and	O
Miss	O
Churchill	O
of	O
Enscombe	O
Captain	O
Weston	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
considered	O
especially	O
by	O
the	O
Churchills	O
as	O
making	O
such	O
an	O
amazing	O
match	O
was	O
proved	O
to	O
have	O
much	O
the	O
worst	O
of	O
the	O
bargain	O
for	O
when	O
his	O
wife	O
died	O
after	O
a	O
three	O
years	O
marriage	O
he	O
was	O
rather	O
a	O
poorer	O
man	O
than	O
at	O
first	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
child	O

From	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

he	O
was	O
soon	O

The	O

Some	O

and	O
some	O
reluctance	O
the	O
widower	O
father	O
may	O
be	O
supposed	O
to	O

as	O
they	O
were	O
overcome	O
by	O

the	O

up	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
Churchills	O
and	O
he	O

as	O
he	O
could	O
A	O
complete	O
change	O
of	O
life	O
became	O
desirable	O
He	O
quitted	O
the	O
militia	ORG
and	O
engaged	O
in	O
trade	O
having	O
brothers	O
already	O
established	O
in	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
in	O
London	O
which	O
afforded	O
him	O
a	O
favourable	O
opening	O
It	O
was	O
a	O
concern	O
which	O
brought	O
just	O
employment	O
enough	O
He	O
had	O
still	O
a	O
small	O
house	O
in	O
Highbury	O
where	O
most	O
of	O
his	O
leisure	O
days	O
were	O
spent	O
and	O
between	O
useful	O
occupation	O

the	O
pleasures	O
of	O
society	O
the	O
next	O
eighteen	O
or	O
twenty	O
years	O
of	O
his	O
life	O
passed	O
cheerfully	O
away	O
He	O
had	O
by	O
that	O
time	O
realized	O
an	O
easy	O
competence	O
enough	O
to	O
secure	O
the	O
purchase	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
estate	O
adjoining	O
Highbury	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
always	O
longed	O
for	O
enough	O
to	O
marry	O
a	O
woman	O
as	O
portionless	O
even	O
as	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
and	O
to	O
live	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
wishes	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
friendly	O
and	O
social	O
disposition	O
It	O
was	O
now	O
some	O
time	O
since	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
had	O
begun	O
to	O
influence	O
his	O
schemes	O
but	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
tyrannic	O
influence	O
of	O
youth	O
on	O
youth	O
it	O
had	O
not	O
shaken	O
his	O
determination	O
of	O
never	O
settling	O
till	O
he	O
could	O
purchase	O
Randalls	O
and	O
the	O
sale	O
of	O
Randalls	O
was	O
long	O
looked	O
forward	O
to	O
but	O
he	O
had	O
gone	O
steadily	O
on	O
with	O
these	O
objects	O
in	O
view	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
accomplished	O
He	O
had	O
made	O
his	O
fortune	O
bought	O
his	O
house	O
and	O
obtained	O
his	O
wife	O
and	O
was	O
beginning	O
a	O
new	O
period	O
of	O
existence	O
with	O
every	O
probability	O
of	O
greater	O
happiness	O
than	O
in	O
any	O
yet	O
passed	O
through	O
He	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
an	O
unhappy	O
man	O
his	O
own	O
temper	O
had	O
secured	O
him	O
from	O
that	O
even	O
in	O
his	O
first	O
marriage	O
but	O
his	O
second	O
must	O
shew	O
him	O
how	O
delightful	O
a	O
well	O
judging	O
and	O
truly	O
amiable	O
woman	O
could	O
be	O
and	O
must	O
give	O
him	O
the	O
pleasantest	O
proof	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
better	O
to	O
choose	O
than	O
to	O
be	O
chosen	O
to	O
excite	O
gratitude	O
than	O
to	O
feel	O
it	O
He	O
had	O
only	O
himself	O
to	O

in	O

his	O
fortune	O
was	O
his	O
own	O
for	O
as	O
to	O
Frank	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
than	O
being	O
tacitly	O
brought	O
up	O
as	O
his	O
uncle	O
's	O
heir	O
it	O
had	O
become	O
so	O
avowed	O
an	O
adoption	O
as	O
to	O
have	O
him	O
assume	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Churchill	O
on	O
coming	O
of	O
age	O
It	O
was	O
most	O
unlikely	O
therefore	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
ever	O
want	O
his	O
father	O
's	O
assistance	O
His	O
father	O
had	O
no	O
apprehension	O
of	O
it	O
The	O
aunt	O
was	O
a	O
capricious	O
woman	O
and	O
governed	O
her	O
husband	O
entirely	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
Mr	O
Weston	O
's	O
nature	O
to	O
imagine	O
that	O
any	O
caprice	O
could	O
be	O
strong	O
enough	O
to	O
affect	O
one	O
so	O
dear	O
and	O
as	O
he	O
believed	O
so	O
deservedly	O
dear	O
He	O
saw	O
his	O
son	O
every	O
year	O
in	O
London	O
and	O
was	O
proud	O
of	O
him	O
and	O
his	O
fond	O
report	O
of	O
him	O
as	O
a	O
very	O
fine	O
young	O
man	O
had	O
made	O
Highbury	O
feel	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
pride	O
in	O
him	O
too	O
He	O
was	O
looked	O
on	O
as	O
sufficiently	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
to	O
make	O
his	O
merits	O
and	O
prospects	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
common	O
concern	O
Mr	O
Frank	O
Churchill	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
boasts	O
of	O
Highbury	O
and	O
a	O
lively	O
curiosity	O
to	O
see	O
him	O
prevailed	O
though	O
the	O
compliment	O
was	O
so	O
little	O
returned	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
there	O
in	O
his	O
life	O
His	O
coming	O
to	O
visit	O
his	O
father	O
had	O
been	O
often	O
talked	O
of	O
but	O
never	O
achieved	O
Now	O
upon	O
his	O
father	O
's	O
marriage	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
generally	O
proposed	O
as	O
a	O
most	O
proper	O
attention	O
that	O
the	O
visit	O
should	O
take	O
place	O
There	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
dissentient	O
voice	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O
either	O
when	O
Mrs	O
Perry	O
drank	O
tea	O
with	O
Mrs	O

or	O
when	O
Mrs	O
and	O
Miss	O
Bates	O
returned	O
the	O
visit	O
Now	O
was	O
the	O
time	O
for	O
Mr	O
Frank	O
Churchill	O
to	O
come	O
among	O
them	O
and	O
the	O
hope	O
strengthened	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
understood	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
written	O
to	O
his	O
new	O
mother	O
on	O
the	O
occasion	O
For	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
every	O
morning	O
visit	O
in	O
Highbury	O
included	O
some	O
mention	O
of	O
the	O
handsome	O
letter	O
Mrs	O
Weston	O
had	O
received	O
I	O
suppose	O
you	O
have	O
heard	O
of	O
the	O
handsome	O
letter	O
Mr	O
Frank	O
Churchill	O
has	O
written	O
to	O
Mrs	O
Weston	O
I	O
understand	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
handsome	O
letter	O
indeed	O
Mr	O
Woodhouse	O
told	O
me	O
of	O
it	O
Mr	O
Woodhouse	O
saw	O
the	O
letter	O
and	O
he	O
says	O
he	O
never	O
saw	O
such	O
a	O
handsome	O
letter	O
in	O
his	O
life	O
It	O
was	O
indeed	O
a	O
highly	O
prized	O
letter	O
Mrs	O
Weston	O
had	O
of	O
course	O
formed	O
a	O
very	O
favourable	O
idea	O
of	O
the	O
young	O
man	O
and	O
such	O
a	O
pleasing	O
attention	O
was	O
an	O
irresistible	O
proof	O
of	O
his	O
great	O
good	O
sense	O
and	O
a	O
most	O
welcome	O
addition	O
to	O
every	O
source	O
and	O
every	O
expression	O
of	O
congratulation	O
which	O
her	O
marriage	O
had	O
already	O
secured	O
She	O
felt	O
herself	O
a	O
most	O
fortunate	O
woman	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
lived	O
long	O
enough	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
fortunate	O
she	O
might	O
well	O
be	O
thought	O
where	O
the	O
only	O
regret	O
was	O
for	O
a	O
partial	O
separation	O
from	O
friends	O
whose	O
friendship	O
for	O
her	O
had	O
never	O
cooled	O
and	O
who	O
could	O
ill	O
bear	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
her	O
She	O
knew	O
that	O
at	O
times	O
she	O
must	O
be	O
missed	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
think	O
without	O
pain	O
of	O
Emma	O

losing	O
a	O

an	O

from	O
the	O

her	O
companionableness	O

dear	O
Emma	O
was	O
of	O
no	O
feeble	O
character	O
she	O
was	O
more	O
equal	O
to	O
her	O
